## What is DH to me? 
I was not sure of what to expect when I signed up for this class. I took this class for the last requirement for my digital humanities minor, but this was the first time I have taken a course specifically geared toward digital humanities. To be honest, I was a little hesitant and also a little scared since I wasn’t sure what DH was about. 

My original definition of digital humanities was “digital humanities can be described as using technological tools in order to conduct research and inform people about DH projects. The field is ever-changing, and even technological tools used 10 years ago have become outdated. Because of this, I think DH is an important field today due to its ability to adapt and change along with us.” 

Recently, we revisited our original definitions of DH in class. My final definition of digital humanities adds to my original definition a bit. It goes as follows - “DH just isn’t about researching and informing people about other projects. The biggest thing that I’ve learned about DH is that it plays a huge role in the creation of those projects, while building off of previous research. The most important thing that I’ve learned about DH, especially through the grant project, is the significance of these projects. It’s taking topics and other fields and making them more engaging and more interactive.”

## Readings
 When it came to the readings for this class, I enjoyed how some of the readings weren’t solely focused on content or topics from class. What I mean by this is how some readings were integrated in a more interactive way. For example, the Github and markdown tutorials were super useful in learning different softwares for assignments. They were very beneficial in providing examples of DH projects. They were not only helpful for specific assignments, but they were very useful skills to learn for future jobs. They’re definitely a skill to include on a resume, especially if you’re interested in marketing or recruiting. 

## Assignments
In terms of assignments, I really enjoyed the blog posts. I thought that they were a different way of discussion boards, but they also integrated some aspects from class into posting them, such as coding the text correctly or adding photos to a post. I especially enjoyed the review blog since it was about analyzing a DH project, which I have never done before. Also, the project that I chose to write about was super interesting. It was about Charles Booth, who was an English industrialist and social reformer.

Sidenote: I also really liked tweeting about class and the readings each week. While I sometimes had a hard time coming up with things to tweet about, it was nice to see what my classmates thought about different readings, class concepts, and assignments. 

The one assignment that I struggled with the most was the grant project. I had no trouble with coming up with ideas or doing research, but I had some difficulty when it came to actually writing about what I wanted a project to be about (i.e. the first draft and some of the final draft). I think I struggled the most on this assignment because it was hard for me to envision a project without developing it but still writing a paper about it. At first, it kind of confused me. I’m not going to lie, I thought I was actually creating the project instead of writing a grant proposal for one for the first week and a half after talking about it in class. Obviously, this wasn’t the case, but I eventually found my footing and was able to complete the project the way I was supposed to. 


## Conclusion
Overall, my outlook on digital humanities has definitely changed in the best way. I think this course has made me a better reader and writer. The readings provided useful information on how to become a better reader and writer by using different strategies and how to understand varying reading/writing styles.

At the beginning of the semester, my goal for this class was to learn about the field of DH and how I can incorporate those skills into my life after college. I feel as though my college education has kind of come full circle in a way. 

My major is communication studies with a minor in business administration, so I feel like DH has kind of combined those two fields together and added a coding aspect to it. Coding in any form is a very useful tool nowadays, so I’m super excited to keep that skill in my back pocket. I really enjoyed this class and everything it has taught me this semester!
