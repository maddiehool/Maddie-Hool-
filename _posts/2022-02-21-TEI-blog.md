For this blog, we used [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)] (https://cdrh.unl.edu/articles/basicguide/TEI) to code portions of Bram Stoker’s *Dracula's Guest*. This is a short horror story that was published in 1914 after Stoker’s death. My assignment was to read a few paragraphs from pages 6 and 7 of *Dracula’s Guest*. The main point of this activity was to gain some experience using [eXtensible Markup Language (XML)] (https://www.w3.org/XML/) in the coding program Oxygen. 

## Markup on Google Docs
We were assigned certain parts of *Dracula’s Guest* through a Google Doc. After reading the excerpt I was assigned, I had to go through the assigned reading in order to markup the text by leaving comments. The comments had to include things that we would have to code later in Oxygen. These codes included paragraphs beginning and ending, em-dashes, page beginnings, etc. I found this very helpful because it made the coding section easier in Oxygen.

I was lucky enough to have a fairly easy section of the reading. For example, I had to make comments about an em-dash, a page beginning/ending, and multiple comments about a paragraph beginning/ending. I didn’t really have any specific codes in regards to the story, such as inscriptions, addresses, and titles. 

 ## Experience Using Oxygen
Even though I have some experience with HTML and some Python, I was sort of scared of this assignment. Coding is something that is foreign to me, however, it’s very detail-oriented, which I really enjoy. One of the best features in Oxygen was the “Author” feature. This allows users to preview their work as they code. I really liked this feature because I didn’t have to open up multiple tabs in order to view my finished work. After working through Oxygen during class, I realized that it was very similar to HTML with some variations of different codes. I had no idea that there was a code for an em-dash, let alone what the actual code was.

Although I had to get over some fears at the beginning of this assignment, I found comfort in knowing the similarities between XML and HTML. This also gave me some confidence in coding my excerpt instead of second guessing myself and looking over the program a million times. 

## Conclusion
All in all, I really enjoyed this project. I learned some new tags and new things to use tags for. For example, I don’t have to use a specific tag to use an address for HTML, however, there’s a specific tag for it in XML. I think getting exposed to other programming languages and programs allows us to be more well rounded in some aspects of digital humanities. This is something that could also be beneficial in the future when it comes to getting jobs and standing out to other candidates.
