Hi everyone! My name is Maddie Hool and I’m a fifth year senior here at Christopher Newport University and I’m also on the [softball team](https://www.cnusports.com/sports/softball/roster/maddie-hool/17491). My pronouns are she/her/hers. I graduated in May with my BA in Communication Studies and a minor in Business Administration. Graduating from college is something that I hold in a high regard as I am a first generation college student and graduate. 

Some of my academic successes include being named to the Dean’s List and making our conference All-Academic team. While being a communication studies major, I was inducted into Lambda Pi Eta, which is the Communication Honor Society here on campus. 

After being granted another year of [eligibility](https://www.ncsasports.org/coronavirus-sports/ncaa-eligibility-coronavirus) from the NCAA, I decided to take another year to play and complete another minor in Digital Humanities. Digital Humanities is a new field to me and this is the first class I’ve taken that’s specifically geared toward DH. However, I’m excited to learn more about it throughout the course of the semester. 

## Background

I’m from Dale City, Virginia, which is about two and a half hours away from CNU. I grew up playing softball, so I’m very thankful that I get to play it for another year. Since I’ve always been active, I love working out and going on walks. Outside of school and softball, I like to hang out with my friends and listen to music. Some of my favorite artists include Dominic Fike, Ruel, and FLETCHER. 

When I’m home, I love being around my three dogs who are pictured below. I have three labrador retrievers - Harper (back), Olive (middle), and Murphy (front), who are all monsters but I love them anyway.

For the past two summers, I’ve worked at a retirement home near my hometown with my mom. I had a more hands-on position, which allowed me to directly work with the residents. It gave me the ability to build connections with some residents who have direct contact with people in high positions at a lot of different companies. 

However, my mom is in charge of the billing for the departments and for the residents. Because of this, I’m very interested in [human resources](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/humanresources.asp), [marketing](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-marketing), and [business analytics](https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/business-analytics) as a career path and I hope to start a career when I’m finished with school this year. I believe that my background in communication studies, business, and now digital humanities will allow me to hopefully pursue a career in one of those areas of interest. 

Since DH is new to me I hope to learn more about the field, how it can be beneficial to the rest of my academic career, and how it can prepare me for my future career.
