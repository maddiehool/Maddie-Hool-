_Project:_ Charles Booth's London

_Project Director(s):_ London School of Economics & Political Science

## History
    
According to this website, Charles Booth was “an English industrialist and social reformer.” This digital humanities project pulls information from Charles Booth’s Inquiry Into Life and Labour in London. Booth worked on this project from 1886-1903. 

## Summary

Charles Booth’s London is an interactive website that takes his surveys about life in London. The website shows the poverty maps and notebooks he wrote right before the 20th century. The main feature of the project is the map. A key feature of the map includes the ability to compare Charles Booth’s poverty maps to modern areas of London. This feature also gives users the ability to view London through different time periods, not just modern day. Users can also scroll and navigate the city as they please.

The notebooks include interviews from a wide range of people living in London. The highlights of the notebooks are about drinking, drugs, migrant communities, and prostitution.

## Design

This website was pretty easy to navigate. The homepage states everything the project was about. The navigation bar in the top right of the screen provides drop down menus for each topic.

Browsing through the map was pretty easy and very interesting. The main features include searching the map, seeing where Booth wrote a notebook, and a legend. My favorite thing about the map section was how you could compare Booth’s map of London to a modern day map of London.

Yet, on the mobile site, this feature is not there. You can still search the maps and click the book button in the top right corner to see where Booth wrote certain notebooks.

## Findings

After clicking on the “Browse the Notebooks" section, the website provides a list of notebooks to choose from. The pages are very informative and tell you everything you need to know about each notebook. This includes being able to search which district of London you would like to look at. 

The most interesting piece of this project was the “Highlights” section. After this, the website prompts the user to click on a sub-section. These sub-sections include drink and drugs, migrant communities, and prostitution. After picking a sub-section, the project provides a summary of that highlight. Included in the highlights are pictures and excerpts from notebooks as well. This section is very informative and provides background about London at the time.

The site is very pleasing and well organized. One thing that bothered me was the presentation of the notebooks to the user. They're shown in a grid pattern (pictured below). This includes a small picture of each notebook and the location of where Booth wrote it. I would’ve liked to see them in a listed pattern, but I understand why the project director chose this layout. Putting the notebooks in a listed pattern and ordering them by location would make the page layout more cohesive. This also maintains the original purpose of these pages.

All the information a user needs for navigating this project is clear. Even though this is the case, another critique that I have is that important background information was at the bottom of the page. Important background information should be at the top of the page. This way, people who don’t know who Charles Booth was would have a laid foundation on why this project is important. 

Overall, this project is very informative. Before reviewing this website, I didn’t know who Charles Booth was or what he did. This website did a great job at educating people about him and what he did. I enjoyed navigating this project and learning about Charles Booth’s notebooks and maps.
