## History

  According to this website, Charles Booth was “an English industrialist and social reformer.” This digital humanities project pulls information from Charles Booth’s Inquiry Into Life and Labour in London. Booth worked on this project from 1886-1903. 

## Summary

  Charles Booth’s London is an interactive website that takes his surveys about life in London. The website shows the poverty maps and notebooks he wrote right before the 20th century. The main feature of the project is the map. A key feature of the map includes the ability to compare Charles Booth’s poverty maps to modern areas of London. This feature also gives users the ability to view London through different time periods, not just modern day. Users can also scroll and navigate the city as they please.

  The notebooks include interviews from a wide range of people living in London. The highlights of the notebooks are about drinking, drugs, migrant communities, and prostitution.

## Design

  This website was pretty easy to navigate. The homepage states everything the project was about. The navigation bar in the top right of the screen provides drop down menus for each topic.

  Browsing through the map was pretty easy and very interesting. The main features include searching the map, seeing where Booth wrote a notebook , and a legend. My favorite thing about the map section was how you could compare Booth’s map of London to a modern day map of London. 

  Yet, on the mobile site, this feature is not there. You can still search the maps and click the book button in the top right corner to see where Booth wrote certain notebooks.
